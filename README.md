Gem Wallet is an open-source mobile wallet for iOS and Android. This repository is the monorepo for both apps and the shared Rust core submodule they build against.

- `ios/`: SwiftUI application, packages, tests, and iOS-only submodules
- `android/`: Kotlin/Compose application and Android build tooling
- `core/`: shared Rust submodule used by both mobile apps

📲 [iOS on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6448712670?ct=github&mt=8)

🤖 [Android on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gemwallet.android&utm_campaign=github&utm_source=referral&utm_medium=github)

## Features

- Open source, self-custodial wallet with multi-chain support
- Native iOS and Android apps with shared Rust-based blockchain functionality
- Swaps, staking, WalletConnect, fiat on/off ramp, alerts, and market data

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gemwalletcom/wallet.git
cd wallet
```

2. If needed, initialize submodules later:

```bash
just setup-git
```

### iOS

> [!NOTE]
> iOS builds require macOS. Apple silicon is the default supported environment for Gemstone builds.

```bash
cd ios
just bootstrap
just spm-resolve
just build-for-testing
```

If you are using an Intel Mac, update `core` and run `just generate-stone` to build the additional `x86_64` Gemstone artifacts.

### Android

```bash
cd android
just bootstrap
just build-test
```

Add GitHub Packages credentials to `android/local.properties` before Android builds that need private package access:

```properties
gpr.username=<your-github-username>
gpr.token=<your-github-token>
```

## Developer Shortcuts

The repo root exposes monorepo commands plus module access to each platform:

```bash
just build
just generate
just localize
just bump patch
just ios bootstrap
just ios build
just ios build-for-testing
just ios test-without-building
just android bootstrap
just android build
just android build-test
just android test
```

Platform-specific commands remain available through the [`ios`](ios/justfile) and [`android`](android/justfile) just modules.
